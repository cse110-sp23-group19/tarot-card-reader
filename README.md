## Jest
We are using Jest as our unit test service. To run unit tests do the following:
1. Export all necesary functions using `module.exports`
2. Create a seperate file with the 'test' keyword between the initial file name and '.js' for example to test 'unit.js' we create a complementary file called 'unit.test.js'.
3. Write the unit test for the required function following Jest guidlines
4. Finally, run `npm test` to run all unit test in the repository.
Here is an example output:
